## What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves techniques from various fields including mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge.

## Key Concepts

- **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources such as databases, web scraping, sensors, and surveys.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processing and cleaning the data to handle missing values, outliers, and errors.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing and visualizing the data to understand its structure and patterns.
- **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models using algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of data to communicate findings effectively.
- **Big Data**: Handling and analyzing large datasets that cannot be processed using traditional data processing tools.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Big Data Technologies**: Hadoop, Spark
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
